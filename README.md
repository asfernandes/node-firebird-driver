# Firebird client interfaces for Node.js / TypeScript

This project currently has only TypeScript interfaces for a Firebird client. In the future it may have common code for any Firebird client,
like connection pools and utility functions.

## Native client

If you are looking to use Firebird from a Node.js application or library, look at:

https://github.com/asfernandes/node-firebird-driver-native.git / https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-firebird-driver-native.git

There is also plan to create a socket-based (pure Node.js) driver.

## Installation

npm install --save node-firebird-driver

## Warning

This project is in ALPHA state and the API is subject to change.
